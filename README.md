# School Timetable Generator (Java)

## Project Overview

Welcome to the School Timetable Generator—a smart Java solution for one of education's toughest puzzles! This project tackles the challenge of scheduling classes, subjects, and teachers into a perfect weekly timetable, balancing all requirements and constraints. Dive in to explore how algorithms and clean code can solve real-world problems and create order from chaos.

## Features

- Flexible data model for classes, subjects, and teachers
- Satisfies all scheduling constraints (no double-booking, qualified teachers, required periods)
- Extensible for new features and constraints
- Clear, readable output
- Built-in validation

## Directory Structure

```
school-timetable-generator-main/
├── SchoolTimetableGenerator.java   # Main Java solution
├── README.md                      # Project documentation
```

## How to Run

1. Compile the Java code:
   ```
   javac SchoolTimetableGenerator.java
   ```
2. Run the program:
   ```
   java SchoolTimetableGenerator
   ```

## Customization

- Add or modify classes, subjects, or teachers in the `main` method of `SchoolTimetableGenerator.java`.
- Extend validation or output as needed.

## Example Output

```
Timetable is valid!

Timetable for Class 6A:
  Monday:
    Period 1: English (Bob)
    Period 2: English (Bob)
    ...
```

## Why This Project Stands Out

- Real-world scheduling problem
- Clean, modular Java code
- Easy to extend and maintain
- Perfect for technical interviews and portfolio
